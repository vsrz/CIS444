				<p>
					The problem with social media today is that you can be presented with too much information up front; anything
					that is not popular or is not recent will be dropped away from sight and interest.</p>
				<p>
					Instead imagine a website where you update information as you normally would and then whenever you feel curious,
					you can surf a pool of links your friends like. Our website with a click of a button will navigate to a random 
					websites provided by your friends.</p>
				<p> 
					In addition, the site will attempt to pair you with others who may have similar interests and suggest some
					of their links to you as well. This strategy unites the interests of your friends and others with your own.
					There is finally an avenue where you can expose yourself to something new or expand upon a topic that you
					are already familiar with.</p>
